## Where am I?

Hi there! If you're here, probably **you have some free time this weekend and you want to learn something new**. Exactly what happened to me, but I wasn't that lucky: my searches made no good results.

So, I decided to create **a list of things that I could learn in a weekend**!

## I want to contribute!

Glad to hear that! Take a look to the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Many other developers [already added something](https://github.com/francescomalatesta/weekend-learning/graphs/contributors)!

#### Methodologies

- **_Read about the S.O.L.I.D. principles_**: *never heard of them? Time to fix the bug. As you [can see on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), these principles are the very basics of good code in object oriented programming. Nothing really complicated by the way, so choose your favourite language and learn them!*;
- **_Learn a Design Pattern_**: *design patterns are recurring solutions for common problem in software design. If you don't know them, you can easily [find the book with a search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Design+Patterns%3A+Elements+of+Reusable+Object-Oriented+Software) and study a couple of them every weekend. If you don't want to buy the book, don't worry: internet is full of articles about them.*;
- **_Learn Test driven development (TDD)_**: *is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. [See more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).*;

#### Protocols

- **_OAuth2_**: *OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization. It's used to log users into third party services without exposing sensible credentials, like passwords. This [article on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) is a very good overview on the subject, and the [OAuth2 Framework specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) describes everything in depth.*;
- **_HAL_**: * HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. In short, it will make your API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers.
APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also simple enough that you can just deal with it as you would any other JSON.[HAL specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)*;

#### PHP

- **Frameworks**
  - **_Learn Laravel Basics_**: *Laravel is a widely used PHP full stack framework that you can use to build a project in a very short time. Sometimes in a weekend. The [Basic Task List](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/quickstart) page in the documentation can be a perfect start.*;
  - **_Learn Symfony Basics_**: *Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a Philosophy, and a Community — all working together in harmony. The [Symfony Book](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html) is the main resource to start.*;

- **ORM/ODM**
  - **_Learn the basics of Doctrine ORM_**: *Doctrine is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP 5.4+ that provides transparent persistence for PHP objects. It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic from the persistence in a relational database management system. Look at [this getting started](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started.html) for a first overview.*;
  - **_Learn the basics of Doctrine ODM_**: *Doctrine MongoDB Object Document Mapper is built for PHP 5.3.0+ and provides transparent persistence for PHP objects to the popular MongoDB database by 10gen. Look at [this getting started](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started.html) for a first overview.*;

#### Javascript

- **NodeJS**
  - **_Beginner Overview on NodeJS_**: *Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. You probably have seen many articles and sites, here and there on the web, talking about it. I have found [this really good introductory article](http://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginner-splurge-in-node-js/) to move your first steps in this world*;
  - **_Beginner Guide on NPM_**: *npm is the NodeJS tool used to install and manage dependencies. You can use to install packages both locally (for a specific project) and globally (making it available to the entire system). [This article on Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/) is a nice starter to explore it.*;
  - **_Practice with NodeJS technologies_**: *You can learn Node.js and similar javascript technologies through interactive exercises by simply installing workshops using npm. All the information to do that are in the official site  [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/).*;
  - **_hapi.js_**: *hapi.js is a javascript framework that runs on NodeJS that you can use to build applications and services. The [getting started](http://hapijs.com/tutorials) page can be a good entry point, but the documentation also covers other aspects, like [authentication](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth), [routing](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/routing) and [view](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/views)*;
- **ReactJS**
  - **_Beginner Overview on ReactJS_**: *React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in MVC. ReactJS was born to building large applications with data that changes over time. The Facebook Getting Started is great to begin [Facebook Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html). Also [Facebook Guides](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html) are great.*;
  - **_ReactJS How To_**: *ReactJS is just a "UI Components builder", but it alone is useless. A great resource to study his ecosystem is [Pete Hunt's ReactJS How To](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto)*;
  - **_Build your First ReactJS App_**: *Egghead created a lot of valid basic ReactJS tutorials. One of these is [Build your first ReactJS App](https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application)*;  

#### Tools

- **Fundamentals**
  - **_Git_**: *Git is the actual standard for source code versioning. It's like saving your game and resume it from the last checkpoint if something goes wrong... [try this nice start guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), you'll never go back!*;
  - **_Git Flow_**: * git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model. [try this nice start guide] (http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html)*;
- **Emails**:
  - **_MJML_**: *[MJML](http://www.mjml.io) is a templating engine by the fine folks at mailjet.com, built on React.js. It enables you to code responsive emails with a really simple but flexible syntax, that will be automatically compiled into HTML tables for you to use in your email marketing service of choice.*;
- **Virtualization**
  - **_Docker_**: *Docker is an awesome tool that you can use to wrap your application in many isolated units, called "containers", and quickly deploy them everywhere. It's like virtualization, but without hardware/os virtualization. That's why it's one of the most used solution nowadays. [This video series](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training) (just ~3hrs) can give you a nice overview of the thing.*;

#### Miscellaneous

- **_Learn Markdown_**: *Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed to be converted to HTML. It's often used for readme files. This list is written in Markdown! [The official specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) can be a good start to learn it.*;

#### Bots

- **_Telegram_**: *Explore Telegram Bot API and run your automated tasks using Telegram Apps. Read [the official API documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/)*;
