## Where am I?

Hi there! If you're here, probably **you have some free time this weekend and you want to learn something new**. Exactly what happened to me, but I wasn't that lucky: my searches made no good results.

So, I decided to create **a list of things that I could learn in a weekend**!

## I want to contribute!

Glad to hear that! Take a look to the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The List

- **Methodologies**
    - Read about the S.O.L.I.D. principles: *never heard of them? Time to fix the bug. As you [can see on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), these principles are the very basics of good code in object oriented programming. Nothing really complicated by the way, so choose your favourite language and learn them!*;
    - Learn a Design Pattern: *design patterns are recurring solutions for common problem in software design. If you don't know them, you can easily [find the book with a search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Design+Patterns%3A+Elements+of+Reusable+Object-Oriented+Software) and study a couple of them every weekend. If you don't want to buy the book, don't worry: internet is full of articles about them.*;
    - Learn Design pattern for php *I will suggest [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028062.do) or if you want to compare design patterns with many languages I strongly suggest [this website](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) and the related book*;
    
- **Protocols**
  - OAuth2: *OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization. It's used to log users into third party services without exposing sensible credentials, like passwords. This [article on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) is a very good overview on the subject, and the [OAuth2 Framework specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) describes everything in depth.*;

- **PHP**

    - Learn the Laravel Basics: *Laravel is a widely used PHP full stack framework that you can use to build a project in a very short time. Sometimes in a weekend. The [Basic Task List](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/quickstart) page in the documentation can be a perfect start.*;

  - _**Compiled php**_
    - Learn Zephir-lang: *In a functional world which need shared nothing architecture php is losing market power and credibility. Php developer must improve their Kempo. In order to do this I'll suggest to study [zephir-lang](http://zephir-lang.com/) a C compiled php version.*;
    - Learn HHVM: *Facebook JIT compiled php. You can find [here](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/) the original documentation, it's very similar to the jvm principle, well I suggest you to don't expect all time benefits, it works and it works good but only in certain situation. However a must.*;
  
  - _**Testing and Delivery**_

Here a [very good link](https://jtreminio.com/2013/03/unit-testing-tutorial-introduction-to-phpunit/)*;
    - Learn Behat: *If Unit testing it's not enough for you to know properly your application... well then you're enlightened and if you live in uk your earning a lot of money. If you don't maybe you would like to study from [this link](http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/)*;
